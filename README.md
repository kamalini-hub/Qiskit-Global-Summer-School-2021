## About
The Qiskit Global Summer School 2021 is a two-week intensive summer school designed to empower the next generation of quantum researchers and developers with the skills and know-how to explore quantum applications on their own. This Repository contains the lab exercises of the summer school.

### Quantum Computing 
For the year 2021 the Summer School's curriculum had a practical and applied introduction to quantum computer programming, using IBM's free cloud-based quantum machines and Qiskit. The school commenced by introducing the concepts of Qubits-basic unit of quantum information, quantum gates circuits, algorithms and that all the calculations are based on the probability of an object's state before it is measured - instead of just 1s or 0s - which means they have the potential to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers.

### Quantum machine learning
QML is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. Implementation of QML Algorithms on simulators and hardwares, were the key ingredient of the course. This was done by creating tangible connections between QML, Quantum Computing, hardware and current research in the field.
Exploring QML applications while understanding their limitations and potential by the esteemed lecturers was a great experience.
